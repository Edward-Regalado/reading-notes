## CRUD

- 100's = Informational status codes; header part of request recieved and the server will try to comply with a transmission demand of the client.
- 200's = Succes codes; request was accepted. Regarding asynchronous processing of a request (202), this doesn't mean the request was successfully processed only that it met all validation requirements.
- 300's = Redirection Codes. Tells the client that the resource requested isn't available at the expected location anymore.
- 400's = Client Error codes. Invalid requests that a client sent to a server. (timeouts, wrong URL, missing Authentication, etc.)
- 500's = Sever Error codes. Overwhelmed server or unreachable servers behind proxies, but sometimes can be related to client requests that trigger error exceptions on the server.

1. What is a status code 202? Accepted. This code tells the client that the request was valid, but its processing will finish sometime in the future.
2. What is a status code 308? Permanent redirect. This tells the clients to use another URL to access the resource and not use the current URL anymore. It's helpful to have multiple endpoints for one resource.
3. What code would you use if an update didn't return data to a client? 204 No Content.
4. What code would you use if a resource used to exist but no longer does? Either 404 (Not Found) or 204 (No Content).
5. What is the 'Forbidden" status code? 403 Forbidden. The client has authorized or doesn't need to authorize itself, but still has no permissions to access the resource. 

## Aditional Resources

1. Why do we need to pull our MongoDB db string out of our server and put it into our .env? Because when you deploy our application we won't be using our localhost, so we need to set it the string to pull from the process.env file, which will be set to a variable.
2. What is middleware? It's code that runs when the server gets a request and before it gets passed to your routes.
3. What does app.use(express.json()) do? Allows our server to except JSON as a body inside of a POST or GET element.
4. What does the /:id mean in a route? It's a parameter that we can access by using req.params.id and allows you to access anything after the /.
5. What is the difference between PUT and PATCH? PUT is a method of modifying resource where the client sends data that updates the entire resource. PUT overwrites the entire entity if it already exists, and creates a new resource if it doesn't exist. PATCH is a method that applies a partial update to the resource. You're only required to send the data that you want to update, and it won't affect or change anything else. For example: if you only want to update the first name on a db, you will only be required to send the first parameter: the first name.
6. How do you make a default value in a schema? const exampleSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  type: Date,
  default: Date.now
})
7. What does a 500 error status code mean? There's an error on the server and it has nothing to do with the user or client using the API.
8. What is the difference between a status 200 and a status 201? 201 means succesfully created an object. Default is 200 which means is a general status code for success. Always use 201 when using the .post() method.
