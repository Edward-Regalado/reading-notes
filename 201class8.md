- CSS treats each HTML element like it's own box, either block-level or an inline box 
- Block-level start on a new line and act as the main building blocks of any layout
- Inline boxes flow between surrounding text
- Its common to group a number of elements inside a <div>
- CSS has positioning schemes that allow you to control the layout of a page
- Normal flow: every block-level element appears on a new line

- Relative Positioning: This moves an element from the position it would be in normal 
flow, shifting it to the 
top, right, bottom or left. 
- Absolute Positioning: positions elements in relation to its containing element 
- Fixed position: a form of absolute positioning that positions the element in relation 
to the browser window
- Floating element- allows you to take that element out of normal flow and position it 
to the far left or right 
of a containing box

element should be

sides of a box 
- Use the <div> element to represent each column when building a web page with columns 
width, float, margin. 
- because screen sizes vary so much, web designers often try to create pages of around 
960-1000 pixels wide 
- Fixed width layouts do not change size as teh user increases or decreases the size fo 
their browser window
- Liquid layouts stretch and contract and use percentages to specify the width of each 
box
