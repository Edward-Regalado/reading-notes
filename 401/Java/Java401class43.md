# Open-Source Software Contribution

- open-source software (OSS) is a rapidly growing industry that provides many benefits to the individual and businesses who use it, as wel as to its programmers.
- provides many advantages and opens door to a number of highly lucrative and rewarding opportunities.

## Improve coding skills

- few industries provide the means to practice on real projects, which is why a lot of dev contribute to OSS 
- not only are you practicing your programming skills, but you also learn and gain feedback from more accomplished programmers.
- provides real-life, first-hand experience and greatly accelerates your learning curve
- some OSS projects now include tickets designed for aspiring programmers to gain genuine programming experience.
- this frees up the core developer's schedule so they can spend that time taking on more difficult issues or improving the software in other ways

## Gain Early Experience

- another motivation is that OSS provides new devs with useful and valuable experience often required by companies for employment, even internships and entry-level positions.
- allows for young devs to get better at reading code produces by other, finding and fixing bugs, and adding their code into the main repository.
- can help secure a position and move you into full-time work and accelerate your career.

## Increase Community and Peer Recognition

- encourages and motivates a dev to improve his/her skills and create a number of opportunities, such as job offers and invitations to attend conferences and events.
- self-recognition and personal achievement- having code accepted by a big OSS project is considered a massive achievement.

## Greater Job Prospects

- can improve your job and career prospects.
- tech companies will spend more time looking at your Github account.
- OSS is visible to the public so potential employers can inspect your code and assess your skills as a developer based on the code your written.
- other benefits include consulting and freelance work

## Improve Software on a User and Business Level

- as a software developer and user of a certain OSS platform, improvements and new features are possible with OSS as opposed to proprietary software
- the desire to contribute can also resonate on a business level if a company is using a piece of open-source software and would like to make some changes or add new features to meet a certain business need. The result is a win-win situation.
- with every OSS, the requirements for non-programming skills and contributions are just as necessary.
- global and constant collaboration is increasing open-source software's popularity and is making the software that we use on a daily basis much better.
