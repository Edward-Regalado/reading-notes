## Random functions
- Randint accepts two paramters: a lowest and highest number. Generate intergers between 1, 5. The first value should be less than the second.
import random 
print random.randint(0, 5) = any iterger (1-5)
- The choice function can often be used for choosing a random element from a list.
random.choice(['red', 'black', 'green'])

import random random.random() * 100

import random
myList = [2, 109, Flase, 10, "Lorem", 482, "Ipsum"]
random.choice(myList)

from random import shuffle
x = [[i] for i in range(10)]
shuffle(x)
Output:

random.randrange(start, stop[, step])


## What is Risk Analysis in Software Testing and how to perform it?
- risk analysis is the process of identifying the risks in applications or software that you built and prioritizing them to test. After that, the process of assigning the level of risk is done. 
- Using risk analysis at the beginning of a project highlists the potential problem areas.
- Helps devs and managers to mitigate the risks.
- Risk that you could encounter: 1. Use of new hardware, 2. Use of new tech, 3. Use of new automation tool, 4. The sequence of code, 5. availability of tests resources for the application.
- Conduct a Risk assement review meeting, use max resources to work on high-risk areas, create Risk Assesment database for future use, Identify and notice the risk magnitude indicators: high, med, low.

## Risk Assessment
- Effect: identify a condition, event or action and try to determine its impact.
- Cause: Initialize scanning the problem and reach to point that could be the most probable reason behind that.
- Likelihodd: is to say that there is a probability that a requirement won't be satisfied.

## How to perform Risk Analysis?
- 1. Searching the risk
- 2. Analyzing the impact of each individual risk
- 3. Measures for the risk identified.
