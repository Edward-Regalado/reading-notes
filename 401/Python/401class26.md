# Getting started with Django

## Object-relational mapper

- class Band(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length = 200)
    can_rock = models.BooleanField(default = True)

- class Member(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField("Member's name", max_lenght = 200)
    instrument = models.CharField(choices = (
        ('g', "Guitar"),
        ('b', "Bass"),
        ('d', "Drums"),
      ),
      max_length = 1
    )
    band = models.ForeignKey("Band")

## URLs and views

- A clean, elegent URL scheme is an important detail in a high-quality web app.
- To design URLs for an application, you create a Python module called a URLconf. It contains mapping between URL patterns and your views.

- from django.urls import path
- from . import views

urlpattern = [
    path('bands/', views.band_listing, name = 'band-list'),
    path('bands/<int:band_id>/', views.band_detail, name = 'band-detail'),
    path('bands/search/', views.band_search, name = 'band-search'),
]

- from django.shortcuts import reader
    def band_listing(request):
        """ A view of all band"""
        bands = models.Band.object.all()
        return render(request, 'bands/band_listing.html', {'bands': bands})

## Templates 

- Django's template language is designed to strike a balance betwen power and ease.
- It's flexible and highly extensible, allowing developer to augment the tamplate languate as needed.

<html>
  <head>
    <title>Band Listing</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>All Bands</h1>
    <ul>
    {% for band in bands %}
      <li>
        <h2><a href="{{ band.get_absolute_url }}">{{ band.name }}</a></h2>
        {% if band.can_rock %}<p>This band can rock!</p>{% endif %}
      </li>
    {% endfor %}
    </ul>
  </body>
</html>

## Forms

- Django provides a powerful form library that handles rendering forms at HTML, validating user-submitted dat, and coverting the data to native Python types.

- from django import forms

class BandContactForm(forms.Form):
    subject = forms.CharField(max_length=100)
    message = forms.CharField()
    sender = forms.EmailField()
    cc_myself = forms.BooleanField(required=False)

## Authentication

- Django comes with a full-featured and secure auth system, which handles user accounts, groups, permissions and cookie-based user sessions.
- Allows users to create account and safely log in/out

from django.contrib.auth.decorators import login_required
from django.shortcuts import render

@login_required
def my_protected_view(request):
    """A view that can only be accessed by logged-in users"""
    return render(request, 'protected.html', {'current_user': request.user})

## Admin

- Django comes with an admin interface, which reads metadata in your models to provide a powerful and production-ready interface that content producers can immediately use to start managing content on your site.
- Provides many hooks for customization.

from django.contrib import admin
from bands.models import Band, Member

class MemberAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):
    """Customize the look of the auto-generated admin for the Member model"""
    list_display = ('name', 'instrument')
    list_filter = ('band',)

admin.site.register(Band)  # Use the default options
admin.site.register(Member, MemberAdmin)  # Use the customized options

## Inernationalization

- Django offers full support for translating text into different languages, plus locale-specific formatting of dates, times, numbers and time zones.
- It lets devs and template authors specify which parts of their apps should be translated or formatted for local languages and cultures.

from django.shortcuts import render
from django.utils.translation import gettext

def homepage(request):
    """
    Shows the homepage with a welcome message that is translated in the
    user's language.
    """
    message = gettext('Welcome to our site!')
    return render(request, 'homepage.html', {'message': message})
      
# How Django Works Behind the Scenes

- Django is a Python-based web framework used by millions of devs and billions of consumers throught popular apps like Instagram.
- It is open source - code is available fro free on Github and can be downloaded onto any computer.
- Originally developed by the Lawrence Journal-World newspaper by Adrian Holovaty, Simon Willison, and Jacob Kaplan-Moss.
- The code became open-source in 2005.
- New major realese every nine months.
