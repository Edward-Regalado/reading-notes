## JavsScript Call Stack

- The call stack is used for function invocation (call).
- these functions are executed one at a time, from top to bottom.
- The call stack is synchronous.
- In Asynchronous JS, we have a callback function, an event, look and a task queue. The cb function is acted upon by the call stack during execution after the cb function has been pushed to the stack by the event loop.
- A stack is a data structure that uses Last in, First Out(LIFO) principle to temp store and mangae function calls.
- The last functino that gets pushed into the stack, is the first to be popped out when the function returns.
- Temp sotre: when a function is called, the function, its params, and vars are pushed inot the call stack to form a stack frame. The stack frame is a memory location in the stack. The mem is cleared when the function returns as it is popped out of the stack.

## Manage function calls

- The call stack maintains a record of the position of each stack frame and knows the next function to be executed, removes after execution.
- Syncrhronous is executing once function at a time, in order- like standing in a checkout line at the grocery store.

## Stack Overflow
- Stack overflow occurs when here is a recursive function(a function that calls itself without an exit point.
- function callMyself() { callMyself();} callMyself();
- The callMyself() will run until the browser throws a "Maximum call size exceeded". This is stack overflow.

## Summary/Key takeaways from the call stack
- It is single-threaded/can only do one thing at a time.
- Code execution is synchronous.
- functions calls/innvocation creates a stack frame that occupies a temp memory.
- It works as a LIFO- last in, first out data structure.

## Javascript Error Message && Debugging
- Error messages appear in your console.
- Declare vars before any declaration is made.

## Syntax Errors
- syntax erros occure when something cannot be parsed.

## Range Errors
- when an object has an invalid length.
- an array cannot have a negative length.

## Type Errors
- these type of errors show up when the types (number, string) you aret trying to use or access are incompatible, like accessing a property in an indefined type of varible.
- var foo = {} foo.bar // undefined.
- making sure something exist before trying to accesss it.

## Debugging
- use console.log() on the varibles you want to check.
- use chrome developer tools and open the file you want to debug.
- use debugger statement in your code in the line you want to break.

## Handling Errors
- use a try catch statement to find errors
- wrap the function code block in a try {} catch {} and console.long(err).

## Tools to avoid runtime errors
- JS is not a compiled languare like Java, so your errors will happen at runtime/when you run the code.
- use quooka to evaluate your code as you type.
- eslint to make sure your sytle guide is consistency and it will grab you an error or two along the way
- TypeScript
- Always remove all the debugging stuff from our code before you ACP.
