## Chapter 3: Object Literals (p. 100-105)
- Objects group together a set of variable and functions to create a model of a something you would recognize from the real world. 
- Variable become know as properties and function become know as methods
- literal notation is the easiest and most popular way to create objects- the object is the {} and thier contents and stored in the var hotel { }
- you can access the properties or methods of an object using dot notation and/or using square brackets var hotelName = hotel['name']/hotel.name;

## Chapter 5: Document Object Model (p 183-242)
- DOM specifies how browser should create a model of an html page and how JS can access and update the contents of a web page while it is in the br
window
- DOM is neither part of HTML or JS; it is a separate set of rules.
- DOM also defines methods and properties to access and update each object in this model, which in turn updates what the user sees in the browser.
- DOM is called object model because it made of objects
- DOM Trees have 4 types of nodes: document nodes, element nodes, attribute nodes and text nodes
- you can select element nodes by their id or class (.getElementByID) attributes, by tage name, or using CSS selector syntax
- element node, you can access and update its content using properties such as textContent and innerHTML or using DOM manipulation techniques
- an alement node can contain multiple text nodes and child elements that are siblings of each other
- in older browers, implementation of the DOM is inconsistent( and is a popular reason for using jQuery).
- browswers offer tools for viewing the DOM tree.
