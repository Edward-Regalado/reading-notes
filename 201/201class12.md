## Daily Reading Notes 12

- charts are better for displaying data visually than tables and have the added benefit that no one is ever going to 
press-gang them into use as a layout tool. Easier to look at and convey data.
- Chart.js, a JS plugin that uses HTML5's canvas element to draw the graph onto the page. 
- <canvas> elment is used with Chart.js
- Write a script that will retrieve the context of the canvas (added to the bottom on the body).
- Chart.js is simple to use adn very flexible. 
- Instalation- download from Github releases or use a Chart.js CDN. 
- <canvas> element has two attributes- width and height- default is set to 300px wide and 150px high.
- canvas creates a fixed-size drawing surface that exposes one or more rendering contexts. 
- only support two primitive shapes: rectangles adn paths.
- fillRect(x, y, width, height): draws a filled rectangle.
- strokeRect (x, y, width, height): draws a rectangle outline. 
- clearRect(x, y, widht, height): fully transparent. 
<!-- - function draw() { -->
  <!-- var canvas = document.getElementById('canvas'); -->
  <!-- if (canvas.getContext) { -->
    <!-- var ctx = canvas.getContext('2d'); -->

    <!-- ctx.beginPath(); -->
    <!-- ctx.moveTo(75, 50); -->
    <!-- ctx.lineTo(100, 75); -->
    <!-- ctx.lineTo(100, 25); -->
    <!-- ctx.fill(); -->
  <!-- } -->
<!-- - } -->
- use lineTo() method for drawing straight lines. 
- To draw circles or arcs, use acr() or arcTo() methods.
- fillStyle = color: sets the style used when filling shapes.
- strokeStyle = color: set the style for shapes' outline. 
- fillText(text, x, y [, maxWidth]): fills a given text at the given (x, y) position. Method for rendering text. 
- strokeText(text, x, y [, maxWidth]): strokes a given text at the given (x, y) position.
