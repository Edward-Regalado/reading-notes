## Daily Reading Notes 10
## Chapter 10: Error Handling & Debugging
- Order of Execution: the order in which statements 
are executed can be complex; some tasks cannot 
complete until another statement or function has run
- every statement in a script lives in one of three 
execution contexts
- Global Context- code that is in the script, but no
in a function. 
- Function Context- code that is being run within a 
function. Each function has its own function context
- Eval Context - Text is executed like code in an 
internal function called eva1(). 
- Variable Scope - the first two execution contexts 
correspond with the notion of scope. 
- Global scope- if a variable is declared outside a 
function, it can be used anywhere because it has 
global scope. If you do not use the var keyword when
creating a variable, it is placed in global scope.
- Function-level scope- when a var is created within
a function, it can only be used in that function. 
## The Stack
- The JS interpreter processes one line of code at a
time. When a statement needs data from another 
function, it stacks (or piles) the new function on 
top of the current task.
- Each time a script enter a new execution context, 
there are two phases of activity: prepare and 
execute. 
- Prepare: the new scope is created, Variables, 
functions and arguments are created, the value of 
this keyword is determined.
- Execute: now it can assign values to the vars, 
reference functions and run their code, execute 
statements.
- In the interpreter, each execution context has its
own variables object. It holds the variables, 
functions and parameters available within it. Each 
execution context can also access its parent's 
variables object. 
- If a JS statement generates an error, then it 
throws an exception. At that point, the interpreter 
stops and looks for exception-handling code. 
- Error objects can help you find where your mistake
are and browsers have tools to help you read them. 
- JS has 7 different types of errors. Each creates 
its own error object, which can tell you its line 
number and gives a description of the error.
