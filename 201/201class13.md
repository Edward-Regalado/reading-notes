The Past, Present & Future of Local Storage for Web Applications
- Cookies are included with every HTTP request, thereby slowing down your web app by needlessly transmitting the same data over and over again. 
- Cookies are unecrypted, unless your entire web application is served over SSL.
- Cookies are limited to 4 kb of data, enough to slow down your app but not enough to be very useful.
- Ideally you'd want a lot of storage, on the client that presist beyond a page refresh and isn't transmitted to the server.
- HTML 5 set out to to solve: provide a standardized API, implemented natively and consistently in multiple browsers, without having to rely on 
third-party plug-ins.
- HTML5 storage is a way for web pages to store named key/value pairs locally, within the client web broswer. 
- HTML5 stores data based on key/value pairs. The named key is a string and the data is stored as a string so you need parseInt and parseFloat() to coerce 
your retrieved data into the expected JS datatype.
- you can treat the localStorage object like an associative array. var foo = localStorage[];
