## Daily Reading Notes 14
## What Google learned from its quest to build the perfect team
- Today on corportate campuses and within university laboratories, psychologist, socialogist and statisticians are devoting themselves to studying everything from team composition to email patterns in order to figure out how to make employees into faster, better adn more productive version of themselves.
- studies show that groups tend to innovate faster, see mistakes more quickly and find better solutions to problems.
- people achieve better results and report higher job satisfaction while working in groups.
- Google's data indicated that psychological safety, more than everything else, was critical to make a team work.
## CSS Transform
- With CSS3 came new ways to position and alter elements.
- transform property comes in tw different settings, two-dimensional and three-dimensional. 
- 2D Rotate- the transform property accepts a handful of different values. The rotate value  provides the ability to rotate an element 0-360 degress. 
- .box-1 { transform: rotate(20deg)}; using a positive value will rotate an element clockwise, neg will rotate the element counterclockwise.
- .box-1 { transform: scale(.75)}; any value between .99 and .01 makes an element appear smaller. 
- .box-1 { transform: scaleX(x, y)}; you can also use the x and y axis to transform an element. 
- the translate value works a bit like relative positioning, pushing and pulling an element in different direction without interrupting the normal flow of the document.
- .box-1 { translate(x, y)}; you can use pixels or percentages in the x and y axis for positioning. 
- Skew is used to distort elements on the horizantal axis, vertical axis or both. .box-1{ transform: skew(x, y)};
- It is common for multiple transforms to be used at once. .box-1{ transform: rotate() scale();} 
- Perspective Depth Value- The perspective value can be set as none or a length measurement. The none value turns off any perspective, while the length value will set the depth of the perspective. The higher the value, the further away the perspective appears, thus creating a fairly low intensity perspective and a small three-dimensional change. 
- 3D rotate- allows you to rotate an element on the x, y and z axis.


## Transitions & Animations 
- CSS3 transitions you have the potential to alter the appearance and behavior of an element in multiple keyframes. 
- There are four transition related properties in total, including transition-property, transition-duration, transition-timing-function, and transition-delay. 
- It is important to note, not all properties may be transitioned, only properties that have an identifiable halfway point.
- The duration in which a transition takes place is set using the transition-duration property. The value of this property can be set using general timing values, including seconds (s) and milliseconds (ms). These timing values may also come in fractional measurements, .2s for example.
- The transition-timing-function property is used to set the speed in which a transition will move. Knowing the duration from the transition-duration property a transition can have multiple speeds within a single duration. 
- Transtion Delay - The delay sets a time value, seconds or milliseconds, that determines how long a transition should be stalled before executing. As with all other transition properties, to delay numerous transitions, each delay can be declared as comma separated values.
- Animations Keyframes - To set multiple points at which an element should undergo a transition, use the @keyframes rule. The @keyframes rule includes the animation name, any animation breakpoints, and the properties intended to be animated.
- Animation Iteration - By default, animations run their cycle once from beginning to end and then stop. To have an animation repeat itself numerous times the animation-iteration-count property may be used.
